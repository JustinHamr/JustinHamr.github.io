        <pr>We made this code by making the story appear at a readable pace. Then after we let the user pick the choices 1 or 2. once the user picked 1 or 2. 
         The code would display the story according to the choice of the user.
         We ran into problems coding because the last portion of the story appeared at the top. We fixed this by making the whole story into a big if 
        statement. Doing the large if statement made the code much easier to create than dealing with variables.</pr>
